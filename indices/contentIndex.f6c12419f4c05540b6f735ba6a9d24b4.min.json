It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.==\n\n\n==Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.==\n\n\n==Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.==\n\n\n==Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.==\n\n\n==Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”==\n\n\n==In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment.

The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.==\n\n\n==At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty.==\n\n\n==Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.==\n\n\n==The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.==\n\n\n==The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.==\n\n**[n] - ** Conflict!\n\n==Progress requires unlearning.==\n\n\n==This is a gradual evolution.==\n\n**[n] - ** Evolutie is 1% elke eeuw.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.==\n\n\n==This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.==\n\n\n==It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.==\n\n\n==Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.==\n\n**[n] - ** Habits is een heuristiek?\n\n==Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.==\n\n**[n] - ** Habit is getraijd in systeem 1 en systeem 2 is bottleneck\n\n==Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.

Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.==\n\n\n==How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.==\n\n\n==The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.==\n\n\n==The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.==\n\n\n==an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.==\n\n**[n] - ** Interessant voor launch!\n\n==the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.==\n\n\n==Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”==\n\n\n==the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.==\n\n\n==, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.==\n\n\n==You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.==\n\n\n==Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (“One in, one out.”==\n\n**[n] - ** Grease groove.

The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.==\n\n\n==In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time==\n\n\n==Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.==\n\n\n==Every habit is context dependent.==\n\n\n==: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).==\n\n\n==In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.==\n\n\n==and visualizes a need for it.==\n\n\n==it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.==\n\n\n==Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.==\n\n\n==Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.==\n\n\n==7 The Secret to Self-Control==\n\n\n==Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.==\n\n\n==Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.==\n\n\n==. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible.==\n\n**[n] - ** Brood in vriezer\n\n==You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.==\n\n\n==Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.==\n\n\n==exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.==\n\n\n==how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation.==\n\n\n==Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.==\n\n\n==Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits==\n\n\n==These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,==\n\n\n==While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.==\n\n\n==. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.==\n\n\n==It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.==\n\n\n==Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.==\n\n\n==Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it.==\n\n\n==Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”==\n\n\n==When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win.==\n\n\n==Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.==\n\n\n==Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward.==\n\n**[n] - ** Behalve als de reward dus op rando tijdstip wordt gegeven.\n\n==These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.==\n\n\n==Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.==\n\n\n==Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.==\n\n\n==You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.==\n\n\n==The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn==\n\n\n==The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].==\n\n\n==Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”==\n\n\n==The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing you want to do.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.==\n\n\n==As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.==\n\n\n==whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.==\n\n\n==Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful. Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.==\n\n\n==Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.==\n\n\n==Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.==\n\n\n==But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.==\n\n\n==Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.==\n\n\n==When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.==\n\n\n==. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.==\n\n\n==Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.==\n\n\n==Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life.==\n\n\n==Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.==\n\n\n==He says things like: You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you. You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all. You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.==\n\n\n==Some of our underlying motives include:* Conserve energy Obtain food and water Find love and reproduce Connect and bond with others Win social acceptance and approval Reduce uncertainty Achieve status and prestige==\n\n\n==Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive.==\n\n\n==Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices.==\n\n\n==You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the appropriate response.==\n\n\n==Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.==\n\n\n==Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive.==\n\n\n==Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.==\n\n\n==The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.==\n\n\n==Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.==\n\n**[n] - ** Stoic. Ik lijd en wordt geleefd door mijn passies.\n\n==To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.==\n\n\n==Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.==\n\n\n==When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different.==\n\n\n==A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.==\n\n\n==These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently sensing.==\n\n\n==You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift.==\n\n\n==Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.==\n\n\n==You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.==\n\n\n==Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.==\n\n\n==once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.==\n\n\n==These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.==\n\n\n==The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.==\n\n\n==Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.==\n\n\n==more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.==\n\n\n==I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.==\n\n\n==As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”==\n\n**[n] - ** Sterk!\n\n==If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.==\n\n\n==Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.==\n\n**[t] - ** [[favorite]] \n**[n] - ** Email is otion\n\n==In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.”==\n\n**[n] - ** Mooe uitspraak. Barrriere doorbreken\n\n==All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.==\n\n**[n] - ** Net alpower auto.mate.s\n\n==Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.==\n\n\n==THE HABIT LINE FIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.==\n\n\n==habits form based on frequency, not time.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.==\n\n\n==Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.==\n\n\n==It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.==\n\n\n==, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.==\n\n\n==If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.==\n\n\n==I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.==\n\n**[n] - ** Denk aan project eliminate\n\n==eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible.

Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.==\n\n\n==Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments.==\n\n**[n] - ** Pareto rule\n\n==What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.==\n\n\n==Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.==\n\n\n==A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.==\n\n\n==The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.==\n\n\n==Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.==\n\n\n==We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.==\n\n\n==You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.==\n\n\n==You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.==\n\n\n==Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the present more than the future.==\n\n\n==Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.==\n\n\n==We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.==\n\n\n==Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress.==\n\n\n==can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*==\n\n\n==Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary. What can we do to make tracking easier? First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated.==\n\n\n==Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day.==\n\n\n==The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.==\n\n\n==I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”==\n\n\n==This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking.==\n\n\n==In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.==\n\n\n==short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.==\n\n\n==This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.==\n\n\n==The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.==\n\n\n==A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.==\n\n\n==You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”==\n\n**[n] - ** Iets met een smart contract?\n\n==Chapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.==\n\n\n==In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.”==\n\n\n==Competence is highly dependent on context.==\n\n**[n] - ** Als je een hoger denkvieau hebt betekent dat niet dat je de inerliggende niveaus beheerst\n\n==A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.==\n\n\n==Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.==\n\n\n==The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.==\n\n\n==one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”==\n\n\n==This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule. The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.==\n\n\n==THE GOLDILOCKS RULE FIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just manageable difficulty. In psychology research this is known as the Yerkes–Dodson law, which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpoint between boredom and anxiety.==\n\n\n==.

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.==\n\n\n==Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.==\n\n\n==avoid being “fair-weather meditators.”==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.==\n\n\n==Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes==\n\n\n==Chapter Summary The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond==\n\n\n==Sorites Paradox,* which talks about the effect one small action can have when repeated enough times. One formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her==\n\n\n==With a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.==\n\n\n==Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.==\n\n**[n] - ** See discipline of desire\n\n==Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act.==\n\n\n==Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.==\n\n\n==Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action.==\n\n\n==This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.”==\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.862886276Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.==\n\n\n==It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.==\n\n\n==learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.==\n\n**[n] - ** Compounding\n\n==In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison.==\n\n\n==what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are==\n\n\n==writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.==\n\n\n==The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets.==\n\n\n==There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way.==\n\n**[n] - ** Pkm is getting thoughts down. GTD\n\n==Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.==\n\n\n==. Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is why none of the typical “10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity” tips you can==\n\n\n==The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001==\n\n\n==What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.==\n\n\n==And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.==\n\n\n==. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned==\n\n**[n] - ** Die regel dat je net 4% buiten je comfort zone moet werken\n\n==. Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions.==\n\n\n==It is about having the right tools and knowing how to use them – and very few understand that you need both.==\n\n**[n] - ** Dus tools in holistisch systeem\n\n==Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place==\n\n\n==The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded.==\n\n\n==. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.==\n\n\n==Rarely would a note stay in isolation.==\n\n\n==He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another.==\n\n\n==Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them.==\n\n\n==But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.==\n\n\n==By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. While other systems start with a preconceived order of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes.==\n\n\n==Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach.==\n\n**[n] - ** Hoe kan je de finish lijn mentaal naar voren halen? Sprints?\n\n==. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.==\n\n**[n] - ** As een mariokart booster\n\n==. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.==\n\n\n==. Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.==\n\n\n==Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270)==\n\n\n==If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.==\n\n\n==Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by==\n\n**[n] - ** Sensemaking\n\n==the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?==\n\n\n==Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about.==\n\n\n==Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic.==\n\n\n==After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.==\n\n\n==Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.==\n\n\n==the best ideas are usually the ones we haven’t anticipated anyway.==\n\n\n==You don’t have to read anything you don’t consider an absolute necessity for finishing your most urgent paper, but you will still encounter a lot of other ideas and information along the way. Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.==\n\n\n==After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested, NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, which pushes the ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono, 1998, 141). The slip-box follows the Russian model: Focus on the essentials, don’t complicate things unnecessarily.==\n\n\n==The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.==\n\n**[n] - ** S slipbox een AI?\n\n==Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.==\n\n**[n] - ** Frictie verwijderen tussen desire wn reward\n\n==.

Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.[11]==\n\n\n==Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all.==\n\n**[n] - ** Daarom is een idee een bouwsteen, het moet gebruikt worden om tot volledig wasdom te komen.

In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?==\n\n\n==The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing.==\n\n**[n] - ** Schaalbaar\n\n==, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.==\n\n\n==The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort.==\n\n\n==quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of==\n\n\n==It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.

A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal.==\n\n\n==The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing.==\n\n\n==writing is not a linear process, but a circular one:==\n\n\n==To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run.==\n\n\n==feedback.

The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections.==\n\n\n==We should be able to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome the most surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, even better, because it brings our project forward.==\n\n**[n] - ** SAC is alleen progressie als confirmation bias.\n\n==The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed.

Taking smart notes is the deliberate practice of these skills. Mere reading, underlining sentences and hoping to remember the content is not.==\n\n**[n] - ** Teken 2 cycli. 1 met lezen zonder smart notes, 1 met lezen, mart notes en feedback.\n\n==Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect:==\n\n\n==This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing. Suddenly, we see the problem.==\n\n\n==become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989). While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form.==\n\n\n==Now we are faced with a clear choice: We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.==\n\n\n==how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do. They make it harder for the student to learn because they set everything up for reviewing, taking away the opportunity to build meaningful connections and to make sense of something by translating it into one’s own language. It is like fast food: It is neither nutritious nor very enjoyable, it is just convenient.==\n\n**[n] - ** Denk aan training PpSen\n\n==learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time.==\n\n\n==Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).[32]==\n\n\n==. You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written.==\n\n\n==Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance – literally. We need this==\n\n\n==distance to think about an argument – otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it.==\n\n\n==. Writing here, too, is not copying, but translating (from one context and from one medium into another). No written piece is ever a copy of a thought in our mind.==\n\n\n==Most people still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe that the only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper.==\n\n\n==Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007==\n\n\n==It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts and not so much about building connections. This is what learning psychologists have rightfully given the derogative term “cramming:” the attempt to reinforce and solidify information in the brain by repetition.==\n\n\n==Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculate that storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one’s lifetime.==\n\n\n==Being too often overwhelmed by memories, associations and synesthetic experiences made it difficult for him to stay in a job and enjoy many of the things we highly value.==\n\n**[n] - ** Is dat wat er gebeurt als je hyperdeditief bent?\n\n==, but it does make sense to shift the attention from storage strength to retrieval strength. Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making sure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.==\n\n\n==Obviously, we don’t want to have to rely on cues in the environment.==\n\n**[n] - ** environment design kan wel helpen\n\n==What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes.==\n\n**[n] - ** Dus 1. Schrijven is leren n 2. Linken is leren\n\n==Memory artists instead attach meaning to information and connect it to already known networks of connections in a meaningful way. One piece of information can become the cue for another and strings or networks of cues==\n\n**[n] - ** Het trucje om twee \"boodschappen\" met elkr te vrijfen. Een aardsppel met bananenmousse.\n\n==The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information==\n\n\n==so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.==\n\n\n==Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues. Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possible connections for new information. If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative.==\n\n\n==This shows that elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!==\n\n\n==As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking.==\n\n\n==As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about.==\n\n\n==Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence.==\n\n\n==. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place.==\n\n\n==The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.==\n\n\n==Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.==\n\n\n==Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes.==\n\n\n==Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions – important facilitators for insight.==\n\n\n==The clarification of differences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every serious academic work anyway==\n\n\n==the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones.==\n\n\n==contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve. A paradox can be a sign that we haven’t thought thoroughly enough about a problem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm.==\n\n\n==The moment one starts to combine these mental models and attach one’s experiences to them, one cannot help but gain what he calls “worldly wisdom.” The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head.==\n\n\n==If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.==\n\n\n==The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes:==\n\n**[n] - ** Cocreatie!\n\n==We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval==\n\n\n==Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in science and in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the “slow hunch.”==\n\n\n==During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn’t make it back.==\n\n\n==But we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. This, too, does not come naturally to us.==\n\n\n==The RAF fell for a common error in thinking called survivorship bias (Taleb 2005).==\n\n\n==providing McMath with whole series in which one kind of mistake was made in multiple variations, sometimes from each generation of developers in the same company (McMath and Forbes 1999).==\n\n**[n] - ** Failed product developments\n\n==Problems rarely get solved directly, anyway.

Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction.==\n\n\n==Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ‘When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.==\n\n\n==Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: ‘We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.’ Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends.

Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?==\n\n\n==This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot.

I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It’s not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.==\n\n\n==This is the personal transaction that’s at the heart of good nonfiction writing.

Surprisingly often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time?==\n\n\n==Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing.==\n\n\n==Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.==\n\n\n==Beware, then, of the long word that’s no better than the short word: “assistance” (help), “numerous” (many), “facilitate” (ease), “individual” (man or woman), “remainder” (rest), “initial” (first), “implement” (do), “sufficient” (enough), “attempt” (try), “referred to as” (called) and hundreds more. Beware of all the slippery new fad words: paradigm and parameter, prioritize and potentialize.==\n\n\n==Don’t inflate what needs no inflating: “with the possible exception of” (except), “due to the fact that” (because), “he totally lacked the ability to” (he couldn’t), “until such time as” (until), “for the purpose of” (for).==\n\n\n==First, then, learn to hammer the nails, and if what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.==\n\n\n==There is no style store; style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it. Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance—and with a toupee there’s always a second glance—he doesn’t look quite right.==\n\n\n==Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.==\n\n\n==The point is that he doesn’t look like himself. This is the problem of writers who set out deliberately to garnish their prose. You lose whatever it is that makes you unique. The reader will notice==\n\n\n==Writers are obviously at their most natural when they write in the first person.==\n\n\n==Therefore I urge people to write in the first person: to use “I” and “me” and “we” and “us.==\n\n\n==Hence the professorial use of “one” (“One finds oneself not wholly in accord with Dr. Maltby’s view of the human condition”), or of the impersonal “it is” (“It is to be hoped that Professor Felt’s monograph will find the wider audience it most assuredly deserves”). I don’t want to meet “one”—he’s a boring guy. I want a professor with a passion for his subject to tell me why it fascinates him.==\n\n\n==Good writers are visible just behind their words.==\n\n\n==Where are these people? It’s hard to glimpse them among all the impersonal passive sentences that say “initiatives were undertaken” and “priorities have been identified.”==\n\n**[n] - ** Communicatie vanuit NVS ook persoonlijk maken\n\n==The same thing is true of writers. Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions.==\n\n\n==Leaders who bob and weave like aging boxers don’t inspire confidence—or deserve it.==\n\n**[n] - ** Maar blijkbaar zijn het wel allemaal leiders.\n\n==“Who am I writing for?” It’s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself.==\n\n\n==(It can always be taken out, but only you can put it in.)==\n\n\n==Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. If you’re not a person who says “indeed” or “moreover,” or who calls someone an individual (“he’s a fine individual”), please don’t write it.==\n\n\n==There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it’s the death of freshness in anybody’s style. It’s the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People—a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you’ll sound like every hack.==\n\n\n==The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.==\n\n\n==Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation.==\n\n\n==The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter—a reminder of all the choices—and you should use it with gratitude. If, having found the scalawag and the scapegrace, you want to know how they differ, then go to the dictionary.==\n\n\n==’s the difference between, say, “serene” and “tranquil”—one so soft, the other strangely disturbing because of the unusual n and q. Such considerations of sound and rhythm should go into everything you write.==\n\n\n==. See if you can gain variety by reversing the order of a sentence, or by substituting a word that has freshness or oddity, or by altering the length of your sentences so they don’t all sound as if they came out of the same machine. An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch. It stays in the reader’s ear.==\n\n\n==“We should apply the test of convenience. Does the word fill a real need? If it does, let’s give it a franchise.”==\n\n\n==We’re still left with the question: What is good usage? One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon.==\n\n\n==I would suggest a similar guideline for separating good English from technical English.==\n\n\n==I don’t want to give somebody my input and get his feedback, though I’d be glad to offer my ideas and hear what he thinks of them. Good usage, to me, consists of using good words if they already exist—as they almost always do—to express myself clearly and simply to someone else. You might say it’s how I verbalize the interpersonal.==\n\n\n==Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first, get your unities straight.==\n\n\n==You learn to write by writing. It’s a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it’s true. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.==\n\n**[n] - ** Geldt dit niet voor alles? habit is frequetie.\n\n==Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?==\n\n\n==As for what point you want to make, every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one.==\n\n\n==Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.==\n\n**[n] - ** Do one thig well\n\n==. Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but where the vibrations are good. Adjust your style accordingly and proceed to whatever destination you reach. Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.==\n\n**[n] - ** Discard plans. Bottom up.\n\n==take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph—it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph. Try to give that sentence an extra twist of humor or surprise, like the periodic “snapper” in the routine of a stand-up comic. Make the reader smile and you’ve got him for at least one more paragraph.==\n\n\n==Readers want to know—very soon—what’s in it for them.==\n\n\n==The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead. Of such a progression of sentences, each tugging the reader forward until he is hooked, a writer constructs that fateful unit, the “lead.”==\n\n\n==One moral of this story is that you should always collect more material than you will use. Every article is strong in proportion to the surplus of details from which you can choose the few that will serve you best—if you don’t go on gathering facts forever. At some point you must stop researching and start writing.==\n\n\n==Another approach is to just tell a story. It’s such a simple solution, so obvious and unsophisticated, that we often forget that it’s available to us. But narrative is the oldest and most compelling method of holding someone’s attention; everybody wants to be told a story.==\n\n\n==Always look for ways to convey your information in narrative form.==\n\n\n==Knowing when to end an article is far more important than most writers==\n\n\n==Something I often do in my writing is to bring the story full circle—to strike at the end an echo of a note that was sounded at the beginning. It gratifies my sense of symmetry, and it also pleases the reader, completing with its resonance the journey we set out on together. But what usually works best is a quotation.==\n\n\n==For the nonfiction writer, the simplest way of putting this into a rule is: when you’re ready to stop, stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.==\n\n\n==The surprise it carries is tremendous. How could it not be a perfect ending? Surprise is the most refreshing element in nonfiction writing.==\n\n\n==Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb.==\n\n\n==. Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work. Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch. Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs.==\n\n\n==Joe saw him” is strong. “He was seen by Joe” is weak. The first is short and precise; it leaves no doubt about who did what. The second is necessarily longer and it has an insipid quality:==\n\n\n==Active verbs also enable us to visualize an activity because they require a pronoun (“he”), or a noun (“the boy”), or a person (“Mrs. Scott”) to put them in motion.==\n\n\n==Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning.==\n\n\n==Short is better than long.==\n\n\n==Verbs are the most important of all your tools. They push the sentence forward and give it momentum. Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully.==\n\n\n==Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.==\n\n\n==If you’re in a part of the country where the dirt is red, feel free to mention the red dirt. Those adjectives would do a job that the noun alone wouldn’t be doing.==\n\n\n==The adjective that exists solely as decoration is a self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the reader.==\n\n\n==Don’t hedge your prose with little timidities. Good writing is lean and confident.==\n\n\n==LITTLE QUALIFIERS. Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw: “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense” and dozens more. They dilute your style and your persuasiveness.==\n\n\n==Very” is a useful word to achieve emphasis, but far more often it’s clutter. There’s no need to call someone very methodical. Either he is methodical or he isn’t.==\n\n\n==The Dash. Somehow this invaluable tool is widely regarded as not quite proper—a bumpkin at the genteel dinner table of good English. But it has full membership and will get you out of many tight corners.==\n\n\n==The dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. “We decided to keep going—it was only 100 miles more and we could==\n\n\n==Also resist using an exclamation point to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic. “It never occurred to me that the water pistol might be loaded!==\n\n\n==The Exclamation Point. Don’t use it unless you must to achieve a certain effect.==\n\n\n==. Humor is best achieved by understatement, and there’s nothing subtle about an exclamation point.==\n\n\n==the semicolon brings the reader, if not to a halt, at least to a pause. So use it with discretion, remembering that it will slow to a Victorian pace the early-21st-century momentum you’re striving for, and rely instead on the period and the dash.==\n\n\n==The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence. “She told me to get in the car—she had been after me all summer to have a haircut—and we drove silently into town.” An explanatory detail that might otherwise have required a separate sentence is neatly dispatched along==\n\n\n==The Colon. The colon has begun to look even more antique than the semicolon, and many of its functions have been taken over by the dash. But it still serves well its pure role of bringing your sentence to a brief halt before you plunge into, say, an itemized list.==\n\n\n==more. I can’t overstate how much easier it is for readers to process a sentence if you start with “but” when you’re shifting direction. Or, conversely, how much harder it is if they must wait until the end to realize that you have shifted.==\n\n\n==MOOD CHANGERS. Learn to alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence.==\n\n\n==It announces total contrast with what has gone before, and the reader is thereby primed for the change. If you need relief from too many sentences beginning with “but,” switch to “however.” It is, however, a weaker word and needs careful placement.==\n\n\n==By its very shape the dash pushes the sentence ahead and explains why they decided to keep going.==\n\n\n==CONTRACTIONS. Your style will be warmer and truer to your personality if you use contractions like “I’ll” and “won’t” and “can’t” when they fit comfortably into what you’re writing.==\n\n\n==(A) “Take the shoes that are in the closet.” This means: take the shoes that are in the closet, not the ones under the bed. (B) “Take the shoes, which are in the closet.” Only one pair of shoes is under discussion;==\n\n\n==Always use “that” unless it makes your meaning ambiguous.==\n\n\n==CONCEPT NOUNS. Nouns that express a concept are commonly used in bad writing instead of verbs that tell what somebody did.==\n\n\n==If your sentence needs a comma to achieve its precise meaning, it probably needs “which.” “Which” serves a particular identifying function, different from “that.”==\n\n\n==Turn these cold sentences around. Get people doing things:==\n\n\n==. Forget the competition and go==\n\n\n==Often you’ll spend a whole day trying to fight your way out of some verbal thicket in which you seem to be tangled beyond salvation. Frequently a solution will occur to you the next morning when you plunge back in.==\n\n\n==Surprisingly often a difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it.==\n\n\n==Keep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual—it catches the eye before it has a chance to catch the brain. Short paragraphs put air around what you write and make it look inviting, whereas a long chunk of type can discourage a reader from even starting to read.==\n\n\n==Paragraphing is a subtle but important element in writing nonfiction articles and books—a road map constantly telling your reader how you have organized your ideas. Study good nonfiction writers to see how they do it.==\n\n**[n] - ** Elke paragraaf een atomic note??\n\n==(I reject “he/she” altogether; the slant has no place in good English.==\n\n\n==Rewriting is the essence of writing well: it’s where the game is won or lost. That idea is hard to accept.==\n\n\n==I don’t like plurals; they weaken writing because they are less specific than the singular, less easy to visualize.==\n\n\n==You won’t write well until you understand that writing is an evolving process, not a finished product.==\n\n\n==. Much of it consists of making sure you’ve given the reader a narrative flow he can follow with no trouble from beginning to end. Keep putting yourself in the reader’s place. Is there something he should have been told early in the sentence that you put near the end? Does he know when he starts sentence B that you’ve made a shift—of subject, tense, tone, emphasis—from sentence A?==\n\n\n==. Don’t annoy your readers by over-explaining—by telling them something they already know or can figure out. Try not to use words like “surprisingly,” “predictably” and “of course,” which put a value on a fact before the reader encounters the fact.==\n\n\n==There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write about.==\n\n\n==No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it seriously. If you follow your affections you will write well and will engage your readers.==\n\n\n==No subject is too specialized or too quirky if you make an honest connection with it when you write about it.==\n\n\n==Never go into an interview without doing whatever homework you can.==\n\n\n==You will be resented if you inquire about facts you could have learned in advance.==\n\n\n==Tell him to stop. Just say, “Hold it a minute, please,” and write until you catch up. What you are==\n\n\n==Taking notes, however, has one big problem: the person you’re interviewing often starts talking faster than you can write.==\n\n\n==Business Writing Writing in Your Job==\n\n\n==Every human event happens somewhere, and the reader wants to know what that somewhere was like.==\n\n\n==People and places are the twin pillars on which most nonfiction is built.==\n\n\n==These are subjective concepts in the eye of the beholder. One man’s romantic sunrise is another man’s hangover.==\n\n\n==As for substance, be intensely selective. If you are describing a beach, don’t write that “the shore was scattered with rocks” or that “occasionally a seagull flew over.” Shores have a tendency to be scattered with rocks and to be flown over by seagulls.==\n\n\n==. But as a writer I’ve learned that scientific and technical material can be made accessible to the layman. It’s just a matter of putting one sentence after another. The “after,” however, is crucial. Nowhere else must you work so hard to write sentences that form a linear sequence. This is no place for fanciful leaps or implied truths. Fact and deduction are the ruling family.==\n\n\n==The chapter is based on a simple principle: writing is not a special language owned by the English teacher. Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly can write clearly, about anything at all. Science, demystified, is just another nonfiction subject. Writing, demystified, is just another way for scientists to transmit what they know.==\n\n\n==A tenet of journalism is that “the reader knows nothing.” As tenets go, it’s not flattering, but a technical writer can never forget it.==\n\n\n==15 Science and Technology==\n\n\n==. For the principle of scientific and technical writing applies to all nonfiction writing. It’s the principle of leading readers who know nothing, step by step, to a grasp of subjects they didn’t think they had an aptitude for or were afraid they were too dumb to understand.==\n\n\n==There’s no limit to how wide the pyramid can become, but your readers will understand the broad implications only if they start with one narrow fact.==\n\n\n==You can take much of the mystery out of science writing by helping the reader to identify with the scientific work being done. Again, this means looking for the human element—and if you have to settle for a chimpanzee, at least that’s the next-highest rung on the Darwinian ladder. One human element is yourself. Use your own experience to connect the reader to some mechanism that also touches his life.==\n\n\n==Another personal method is to weave a scientific story around someone else.==\n\n\n==Another way to help your readers understand unfamiliar facts is to relate them to sights they are familiar with. Reduce the abstract principle to an image they can visualize.==\n\n\n==Another way of making science accessible is to write like a person and not like a scientist. It’s the same old question of being yourself. Just because you’re dealing with a scholarly discipline that’s usually reported in a style of dry pedantry is no reason why you shouldn’t write in good fresh English.==\n\n\n==ve quoted from so many writers, writing about so many facets of the physical world, to show that they all come across first as people: men and women finding a common thread of humanity between themselves and their specialty and their readers. You can achieve the same rapport, whatever your subject. The principle of sequential writing applies to every field where the reader must be escorted over difficult new terrain.==\n\n\n==Countless careers rise or fall on the ability or the inability of employees to state a set of facts, summarize a meeting or present an idea coherently.==\n\n\n==Administrators can be turned into human beings. Information can be imparted clearly and without pomposity. You only have to remember that readers identify with people, not with abstractions like “profitability,” or with Latinate nouns like “utilization” and “implementation,” or with inert constructions in which nobody can be visualized doing something: “pre-feasibility studies are in the paperwork stage.” Nobody==\n\n\n==Once an administrator rises to a certain level, nobody ever points out to him again the beauty of a simple declarative sentence, or shows him how his writing has become swollen with pompous generalizations.==\n\n\n==. If what you write is ornate, or pompous, or fuzzy, that’s how you’ll be perceived. The reader has no other choice.==\n\n\n==Managers at every level are prisoners of the notion that a simple style reflects a simple mind. Actually a simple style is the result of hard work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker or a person too arrogant, or too dumb, or too lazy to organize his thoughts.==\n\n\n==The way to warm up any institution is to locate the missing “I.” Remember: “I” is the most interesting element in any story.==\n\n\n==Sport is now a major frontier of social change, and some of the nation’s most vexing issues—drug abuse and steroids, crowd violence, women’s rights, minorities in management, television contracts—are being played out in our stadiums, grandstands and locker rooms.==\n\n\n==Those are the values to look for when you write about sport: people and places, time and transition.==\n\n\n==One is that critics should like—or, better still, love—the medium they are reviewing. If you think movies are dumb, don’t write about them.==\n\n\n==Yet I suggest several conditions that apply to both good reviewing and good criticism.==\n\n\n==Another rule is: don’t give away too much of the plot. Tell readers just enough to let them decide whether it’s the kind of story they tend to enjoy, but not so much that you’ll kill their enjoyment.==\n\n\n==One sentence will often do the trick.==\n\n\n==A third principle is to use specific detail. This avoids dealing in generalities, which, being generalities, mean nothing. “The play is always fascinating” is a typical critic’s sentence. But how is it fascinating? Your idea of fascinating is different from someone else’s. Cite a few examples and let your readers weigh them on their own fascination scale.==\n\n\n==A final caution is to avoid the ecstatic adjectives that occupy such disproportionate space in every critic’s quiver—words like “enthralling” and “luminous.” Good criticism needs a lean and vivid style to express what you observed and what you think.==\n\n\n==In book reviewing this means allowing the author’s words to do their own documentation. Don’t say that Tom Wolfe’s style is gaudy and unusual. Quote a few of his gaudy and unusual sentences and let the reader see how quirky they are.==\n\n\n==Humor is the secret weapon of the nonfiction writer. It’s secret because so few writers realize that humor is often their best tool—and sometimes their only tool—for making an important point.==\n\n\n==Develop one voice that readers will recognize when they hear it on the page, a voice that’s enjoyable not only in its musical line but in its avoidance of sounds that would cheapen its tone: breeziness and condescension and clichés.==\n\n\n==Never hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft.==\n\n\n==nouns. After verbs, plain nouns are your strongest tools; they resonate with emotion.==\n\n\n==. I’ve used writing to give myself an interesting life and a continuing education. If you write about subjects you think you would enjoy knowing about, your enjoyment will show in what you write. Learning is a tonic. That doesn’t mean you won’t be nervous when you go forth into unfamiliar terrain.==\n\n\n==. Less glamorous gains made along the way—learning, wisdom, growth, confidence, dealing with failure—aren’t given the same respect because they can’t be given a grade.==\n\n**[t] - ** [[favorite]] \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.862886276Z","tags":null},"/notes/Planting-Piet-Oudolf-and-Noel-Kingsbury":{"title":"Planting - Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury","content":"# Planting by Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury\n\n![rw-book-cover()](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-6.71d9a01814f7.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[Piet Oudolf and Noel Kingsbury]]\n- Full Title: Planting\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n### PLANTING – THE BIG PICTURE\n#### GROUPING PLANTS\n==The discipline needed to restrict the numbers of varieties necessary for matrix mixes to work is perhaps too tight for many locations, where a wide variety of plants are needed to engage the onlooker==\n\n**[n] - ** Zoals in een kleine tuin\n\n==Combinations are the basic building blocks of planting design==\n\n\n==Given that color is basically about flowers, and since flowers are relatively short-lived, it makes sense for structure to be seen as the fundamental aspect of ornamental plants, whatever the climate==\n\n**[n] - ** First principle thinking\n\n==Structure plants (Gerüstbilder) are combined with less clearly structural companion plants (Begleiter) and the self-explantory ground-cover plants and filler plants (Füllpflanzen) – the last being short-lived species which fill space in the early years==\n\n**[n] - ** - Structure plants\n- companion plants\n- ground cover + filler plants\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.862886276Z","tags":null},"/notes/Range-David-Epstein":{"title":"Range - David Epstein","content":"# David Epstein\n\n![rw-book-cover|200](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication123/v4/20/4e/86/204e867d-79c6-c308-383c-249413a00624/9780735214491.d.jpg/1858x2775bb.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [[David Epstein]]\n- Full Title: Range - Why generalists triumph in a specialized world\n\n## Highlights\n==But the game’s strategic complexity provides a lesson: the bigger the picture, the more unique the potential human contribution.

He studied high-powered consultants from top business schools for fifteen years, and saw that they did really well on business school problems that were well defined and quickly assessed. But they employed what Argyris called single-loop learning, the kind that favors the first familiar solution that comes to mind. Whenever those solutions went wrong, the consultant usually got defensive. Argyris found their “brittle personalities” particularly surprising given that “the essence of their job is to teach others how to do things differently.” (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Psychologist Barry Schwartz demonstrated a similar, learned inflexibility among experienced practitioners when he gave college students a logic puzzle that involved hitting switches to turn light bulbs on and off in sequence, and that they could play over and over.

The students were not given any rules, and so had to proceed by trial and error.* If a student found a solution, they repeated it over and over to get more money, even if they had no idea why it worked. Later on, new students were added, and all were now asked to discover the general rule of all solutions. Incredibly, every student who was brand-new to the puzzle discovered the rule for all seventy solutions, while only one of the students who had been getting rewarded for a single solution did.

Modern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains. Our most fundamental thought processes have changed to accommodate increasing complexity and the need to derive new patterns rather than rely only on familiar ones. Our conceptual classification schemes provide a scaffolding for connecting knowledge, making it accessible and flexible. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Modern knowledge workers need dynamic and flexible conceptual frameworks to transfer knowledge from one point to another. Such as a pkm system.\n\n==But it is certainly true that modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of “categorical” thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. “[It] is usually quite flexible,” Luria wrote. “Subjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‘abstract thinking.’” (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** This is why we need a pkm system with bidirectional linking - this helps us make new connections between subjects.\n\n==On every exam, amid typical chemistry questions, was something like this: “How many piano tuners are there in New York City?” Students had to estimate, just by reasoning, and try to get the right order of magnitude. The professor later explained that these were “Fermi problems,” because Enrico Fermi—who created the first nuclear reactor beneath the University of Chicago football field—constantly made back-of-the-envelope estimates to help him approach problems.* The ultimate lesson of the question was that detailed prior knowledge was less important than a way of thinking (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** These kind of questions also come up at job interviews for condition\n\n==a kind of thinking called “eduction,” to work out guiding principles when given facts or materials, even in (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Make the unknown known.\n\n==a kind of thinking called “eduction,” to work out guiding principles when given facts or materials, even in (Page 0)==\n\n**[t] - ** [[c1]] \n**[n] - ** Make the unknown known.\n\n### CHAPTER 3: When Less of the Same Is More\n==Even the name of the musical era, “Baroque,” is taken from a jewelers’ term to describe a pearl that was extravagantly large and unusually shaped (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Beethoven podcast!\n\n==It certainly goes against the deliberate practice framework, which only counts highly focused attempts at exactly the skill to be performed (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Deliberate practice is purely focusing on the exact still you want to learn.

The sampling period is not incidental to the development of great performers—something to be excised in the interest of a head start—it is integral. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** That's why it would be good for children to start with gymnastics and maybe one ball sport.\n\n==less. “It seems very clear,” the psychologists wrote, “that sheer amount of lesson or practice time is not a good indicator of exceptionality.” (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Number of hours is a bad metric for performance.\n\n==The psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==The strict deliberate practice school describes useful training as focused consciously on error correction.

That is, the more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example. Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** The more context (connections) you give to a note in pkm system the more established this info gets and the better remember it\n\n==creativity may be difficult to nurture, but it is easy to thwart (Page 0)==\n\n\n==The parents with creative children made their opinions known after their kids did something they didn’t like, they just did not proscribe it beforehand. Their households were low on prior restraint. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==It’s strange,” Cecchini told me at the end of one of our hours-long discussions, “that some of the greatest musicians were self-taught or never learned to read music. I’m not saying one way is the best, but now I get a lot of students from schools that are teaching jazz, and they all sound the same. They don’t seem to find their own voice. I think when you’re self-taught you experiment more, trying to find the same sound in different places, you learn how to solve problems.” (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Self-taught means that you have very specific knowledge that only you have, because nobody else has followed your exact learning trajectory.\n\n### CHAPTER 4: Learning, Fast and Slow\n==There were similarities too. In every classroom in every country, teachers relied on two main types of questions.\nThe more common were “using procedures” questions: basically, practice at something that was just learned. For instance, take the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon (180 × (number of polygon sides − 2)), and apply it to polygons on a worksheet. The other common variety was “making connections” questions, which connected students to a broader concept, rather than just a procedure. That was more like when the teacher asked students why the formula works, or made them try to figure out if it works for absolutely any polygon from a triangle to an octagon (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Despite the teacher’s clever vignettes, it is clear that students do not understand how these numbers and letters might be useful anywhere but on a school worksheet. When she asks where variable expressions might be used in the world, Patrick answers: when you’re trying to figure out math problems. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Problems need to be related to the real world and actual day to day situations for people to understand and see the value.\n\n==Rather than letting students grapple with some confusion, teachers often responded to their solicitations with hint-giving that morphed a making-connections problem into a using-procedures one. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Making-connections problems did not survive the teacher-student interactions. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==content.” (There is a specific Japanese word to describe chalkboard writing that tracks conceptual connections over the course of collective problem solving: bansho.) (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** This is really interesting!\n\n==Teachers in every country fell into the same trap at times, but in the higher-performing countries plenty of making-connections problems remained that way as the class struggled to figure them out. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==for knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, “interleaving.”\nInterleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==When younger students bring home problems that force them to make connections, Richland told me, “parents are like, ‘Lemme show you, there’s a faster, easier way.’” If the teacher didn’t already turn the work into using-procedures practice, well-meaning parents will. They aren’t comfortable with bewildered kids, and they want understanding to come quickly and easily. But for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Let your children solve problems on their own\n\n==Kornell was explaining the concept of “desirable difficulties,” obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** This feels like the fact that we should not always go for immediate shortterm rewards as described in atomic habits.\n\n==One of those desirable difficulties is known as the “generation effect.” Struggling to generate an answer on your own, even a wrong one, enhances subsequent learning. Socrates was apparently on to something when he forced pupils to generate answers rather than bestowing them. It requires the learner to intentionally sacrifice current performance for future benefit. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Similar for taking notes and rewriting info in your own words?\n\n==Being forced to generate answers improves subsequent learning even if the generated answer is wrong. It can even help to be wildly wrong. Metcalfe and colleagues have repeatedly demonstrated a “hypercorrection effect.” The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer. Tolerating big mistakes can create the best learning opportunities. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Could this effect be used in marketing? Ask customers a generating question and provide the answer later?\nThe bigger you fail, the more you learn.\n\n==The study conclusion was simple: “training with hints did not produce any lasting learning.” (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Used for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** My way of learning for rest was by making a Los of old tests. Essentially, this is exactly whet is described here as learning without hints, self-testing.\n\n==If that eighth-grade classroom followed a typical academic plan over the course of the year, it is precisely the opposite of what science recommends for durable learning—one topic was probably confined to one week and another to the next. Like a lot of professional development efforts, each particular concept or skill gets a short period of intense focus, and then on to the next thing, never to return. That structure makes intuitive sense, but it forgoes another important desirable difficulty: “spacing,” or distributed practice. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Spaced-repetition.\n\n==spacing made learning more productive by making it easy to make it hard. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Desirable difficulty\n\n==Repetition, it turned out, was less important than struggle. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** In contrast to habit creation, there it needs to be easy and repetition is key.\n\n==Knowledge increasingly needs not merely to be durable, but also flexible—both sticky and capable of broad application. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Big implication for modern knowledge workers. Again, this necessitates the use of a pkm system, this is both sticky due to elaboration and the bidirectional linking makes for a broad application.\n\n==The feeling of learning, it turns out, is based on before-your-eyes progress, while deep learning is not. “When your intuition says block,” Kornell told me, “you should probably interleave.” (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Interleaving is a desirable difficulty that frequently holds for both physical and mental skills. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Whether the task is mental or physical, interleaving improves the ability to match the right strategy to a problem. That happens to be a hallmark of expert problem solving. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Figuring out the exact problem instead of learning procedures for exact same problems. Reminds me of RSM training identifying the right question.\n\n==Kind learning environment experts choose a strategy and then evaluate; experts in less repetitive environments evaluate and then choose. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Desirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==The research team recommended that if programs want to impart lasting academic benefits they should focus instead on “open” skills that scaffold later knowledge. Teaching kids to read a little early is not a lasting advantage. Teaching them how to hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read can be. As with all desirable difficulties, the trouble is that a head start comes fast, but deep learning is slow. “The slowest growth,” the researchers wrote, occurs “for the most complex skills.” (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Exactly what taking smart notes argues.\n\n==Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems. (Page 0)==\n\n**[t] - ** [[c1]] \n\n### CHAPTER 5: Thinking Outside Experience\n==Deep analogical thinking is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. It is a powerful tool for solving wicked problems, (Page 0)==\n\n\n==It also allows us to understand that which we cannot see at all. Students might learn about the motion of molecules by analogy to billiard-ball collisions; principles of electricity can be understood with analogies to water flow through plumbing. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Related to MAYA.\n\n==Most problems, of course, are not new, so we can rely on what Gentner calls “surface” analogies from our own experience. “Most of the time, if you’re reminded of things that are similar on the surface, they’re going to be relationally similar as well,” she explained. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==A gift of a single analogy from a different domain tripled the proportion of solvers who got the radiation problem. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Very powerful!\n\n==Most problem solvers are not like Kepler. They will stay inside of the problem at hand, focused on the internal details, and perhaps summon other medical knowledge, since it is on the surface a medical problem. They will not intuitively turn to distant analogies to probe solutions. They should, though, and they should make sure some of those analogies are, on the surface, far removed from the current problem. In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous. (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** We need more outside-in thinking! Across, disciplines that at first are unrelated.\n\n==Our natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the “outside view.” The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad. (Page 0)==\n\n\n==Bent Flyvbjerg, chair of Major Programme Management at Oxford University’s business school, has shown that around 90 percent of major infrastructure projects worldwide go over budget (by an average of 28 percent) in part because managers focus on the details of their project and become overly optimistic. Project managers can become like Kahneman’s curriculum-building team, which decided that thanks to its roster of experts it would certainly not encounter the same delays as did other groups. Flyvbjerg studied a project to build a tram system in Scotland, in which an outside consulting team actually went through an analogy process akin to what the private equity investors were instructed to do. They ignored specifics of the project at hand and focused on others with structural similarities. The consulting team saw that the project group had made a rigorous analysis using all of the details of the work to be done. And yet, using analogies to separate projects, the consulting team concluded that the cost projection of £320 million (more than $400 million) was probably a massive underestimate. When the tram opened three years late, it was headed toward £1 billion. After that, other UK infrastructure projects began implementing outside[…] (Page 0)==\n\n**[n] - ** Our access trajectories are similar. We only know the specifics of our own product, so we don't think that our product will have such a long launch time.\n\n==This is a widespread phenomenon. If you’re asked to predict whether a particular horse will win a race or a particular politician will win an election, the more internal details you learn about any particular scenario—physical qualities of the specific horse, the background and strategy of the particular politician—the more likely you are to say that the scenario you are investigating will occur. ... the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before ... the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before ... the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before ... the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before ... the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before ... When a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called “far transfer.” ... But the idea that surface analogies that pop to mind work for novel problems is a “kind world” hypothesis, Gentner told me. Like kind learning environments, a kind world is based on repeating patterns. ... In one famous study, participants judged an individual as more likely to die from “heart disease, cancer, or other natural causes” than from “natural causes.” Focusing narrowly on many fine details specific to a problem at hand feels like the exact right thing to do, when it is often exactly wrong.

The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. Here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the following keys are available:\n- `rel`: The `rel` attribute of the `\u003clink\u003e` tag.\n- `type`: The `type` attribute of the `\u003clink\u003e` tag.\n- `href` (optional): The `href` attribute of the `\u003clink\u003e` tag.\n- `sizes` (optional): The `sizes` attribute of the `\u003clink\u003e` tag.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device.

Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet. This is *highly recommended* but not required.\n\n👀 [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)\n\nFor those who like to live life more on the edge, viewing the garden through Obsidian gets you pretty close to the real thing.\n\n## Publishing Changes\nNow that you know the basics of managing your digital garden using Quartz, you can publish it to the internet!\n\n🌍 [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n\nHaving problems?

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.866886307Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\nNote that both of these steps need to be completed.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```shell\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\n$ go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Scrape all links in your Quartz folder and generate info for Quartz\n$ hugo-obsidian -input=content -output=assets/indices -index -root=.\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n## Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\n$ cd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\n$ hugo server\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.866886307Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

On Unix/Mac systems you can run the following command for a one-line update! This command will show you a log summary of all commits since you last updated, press `q` to acknowledge this. Then, it will show you each change in turn and press `y` to accept the patch or `n` to reject it. Usually you should press `y` for most of these unless it conflicts with existing changes you've made! \n\n```shell\nmake update\n\n# or, if you don't want the interactive parts and just want the update\nmake update-force\n```\n\nOr, manually checkout the changes yourself.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️\n\u003e\n\u003e If you customized the files in `data/`, or anything inside `layouts/`, your customization may be overwritten!\n\u003e Make sure you have a copy of these changes if you don't want to lose them.\n\n\n```shell\n# add Quartz as a remote host\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:jackyzha0/quartz.git\n\n# index and fetch changes\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -p upstream/hugo -- layouts .github Makefile assets/js assets/styles/base.scss assets/styles/darkmode.scss config.toml data \n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.866886307Z","tags":null},"/notes/showcase":{"title":"Showcase","content":"\nWant to see what Quartz can do?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-06-29T17:44:43.866886307Z","tags":null}}
