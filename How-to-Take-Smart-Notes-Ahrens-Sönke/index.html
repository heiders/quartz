If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.==</p><p>==It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.==</p><p>==learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Compounding</p><p>==In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison.==</p><p>==what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are==</p><p>==writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.==</p><p>==The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets.==</p><p>==There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Pkm is getting thoughts down. GTD</p><p>==Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.==</p><p>==. Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is why none of the typical “10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity” tips you can==</p><p>==The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001==</p><p>==What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.==</p><p>==And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.==</p><p>==. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned==</p><p>**[n] - ** Die regel dat je net 4% buiten je comfort zone moet werken</p><p>==.

Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.==</p><p>==Rarely would a note stay in isolation.==</p><p>==He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another.==</p><p>==Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them.==</p><p>==But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.==</p><p>==By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. While other systems start with a preconceived order of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes.==</p><p>==Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Hoe kan je de finish lijn mentaal naar voren halen?

If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.==</p><p>**[n] - ** As een mariokart booster</p><p>==. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.==</p><p>==. Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.==</p><p>==Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270)==</p><p>==If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.==</p><p>==Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by==</p><p>**[n] - ** Sensemaking</p><p>==the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?==</p><p>==Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about.==</p><p>==Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic.==</p><p>==After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.==</p><p>==Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.==</p><p>==the best ideas are usually the ones we haven’t anticipated anyway.==</p><p>==You don’t have to read anything you don’t consider an absolute necessity for finishing your most urgent paper, but you will still encounter a lot of other ideas and information along the way. Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.==</p><p>==After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested, NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, which pushes the ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono, 1998, 141). The slip-box follows the Russian model: Focus on the essentials, don’t complicate things unnecessarily.==</p><p>==The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.==</p><p>**[n] - ** S slipbox een AI?</p><p>==Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Frictie verwijderen tussen desire wn reward</p><p>==. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts==</p><p>==Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.[11]==</p><p>==Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Daarom is een idee een bouwsteen, het moet gebruikt worden om tot volledig wasdom te komen.

A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal.==</p><p>==The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing.==</p><p>==writing is not a linear process, but a circular one:==</p><p>==To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run.==</p><p>==feedback.

Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making sure that the right “cues” trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.==</p><p>==Obviously, we don’t want to have to rely on cues in the environment.==</p><p>**[n] - ** environment design kan wel helpen</p><p>==What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes.==</p><p>**[n] - ** Dus 1.

Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possible connections for new information. If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative.==</p><p>==This shows that elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!==</p><p>==As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking.==</p><p>==As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about.==</p><p>==Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence.==</p><p>==. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place.==</p><p>==The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.==</p><p>==Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.==</p><p>==Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes.==</p><p>==Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions – important facilitators for insight.==</p><p>==The clarification of differences in the use of words and concepts is a major part of every serious academic work anyway==</p><p>==the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones.==</p><p>==contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem – and problems are good because we now have something to solve.
