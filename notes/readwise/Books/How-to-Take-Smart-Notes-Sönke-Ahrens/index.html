If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Compounding</p><blockquote><p>In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Pkm is getting thoughts down. GTD</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place (which is why none of the typical “10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity” tips you can</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Die regel dat je net 4% buiten je comfort zone moet werken</p><blockquote><p>. Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is about having the right tools and knowing how to use them – and very few understand that you need both.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Dus tools in holistisch systeem</p><blockquote><p>Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rarely would a note stay in isolation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. While other systems start with a preconceived order of topics, Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes.</p></blockquote><a href=#2-everything-you-need-to-do><h3 id=2-everything-you-need-to-do><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2  Everything You Need to Do</h3></a><blockquote><p>Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Hoe kan je de finish lijn mentaal naar voren halen? Sprints?</p><blockquote><p>. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - As een mariokart booster</p><blockquote><p>. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (2011, 270)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Sensemaking</p><blockquote><p>the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch – you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the best ideas are usually the ones we haven’t anticipated anyway.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You don’t have to read anything you don’t consider an absolute necessity for finishing your most urgent paper, but you will still encounter a lot of other ideas and information along the way. Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested, NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, which pushes the ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono, 1998, 141). The slip-box follows the Russian model: Focus on the essentials, don’t complicate things unnecessarily.</p></blockquote><a href=#3-everything-you-need-to-have><h3 id=3-everything-you-need-to-have><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3  Everything You Need to Have</h3></a><blockquote><p>The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - S slipbox een AI?</p><blockquote><p>Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Frictie verwijderen tussen desire wn reward</p><blockquote><p>. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes – or worse: a graveyard for thoughts</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.[11]</p></blockquote><a href=#4-a-few-things-to-keep-in-mind><h3 id=4-a-few-things-to-keep-in-mind><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4  A Few Things to Keep in Mind</h3></a><blockquote><p>Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Daarom is een idee een bouwsteen, het moet gebruikt worden om tot volledig wasdom te komen.

The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately.
