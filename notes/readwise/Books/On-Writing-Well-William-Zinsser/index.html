Nobody told all the new computer writers that the essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they’re writing fluently doesn’t mean they’re writing well.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me—some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it? What emotional baggage did he bring along? How did it change his life? It’s not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is the personal transaction that’s at the heart of good nonfiction writing. Out of it come two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: humanity and warmth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Principal thinlking</p><blockquote><p>Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Clutter is the laborious phrase that has pushed out the short word that means the same thing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Beware, then, of the long word that’s no better than the short word: “assistance” (help), “numerous” (many), “facilitate” (ease), “individual” (man or woman), “remainder” (rest), “initial” (first), “implement” (do), “sufficient” (enough), “attempt” (try), “referred to as” (called) and hundreds more. Beware of all the slippery new fad words: paradigm and parameter, prioritize and potentialize.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don’t inflate what needs no inflating: “with the possible exception of” (except), “due to the fact that” (because), “he totally lacked the ability to” (he couldn’t), “until such time as” (until), “for the purpose of” (for).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>First, then, learn to hammer the nails, and if what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is no style store; style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it. Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance—and with a toupee there’s always a second glance—he doesn’t look quite right.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The point is that he doesn’t look like himself. This is the problem of writers who set out deliberately to garnish their prose. You lose whatever it is that makes you unique. The reader will notice</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Writers are obviously at their most natural when they write in the first person.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Therefore I urge people to write in the first person: to use “I” and “me” and “we” and “us.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hence the professorial use of “one” (“One finds oneself not wholly in accord with Dr. Maltby’s view of the human condition”), or of the impersonal “it is” (“It is to be hoped that Professor Felt’s monograph will find the wider audience it most assuredly deserves”). I don’t want to meet “one”—he’s a boring guy. I want a professor with a passion for his subject to tell me why it fascinates him.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Good writers are visible just behind their words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where are these people? It’s hard to glimpse them among all the impersonal passive sentences that say “initiatives were undertaken” and “priorities have been identified.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Communicatie vanuit NVS ook persoonlijk maken</p><blockquote><p>The same thing is true of writers. Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Leaders who bob and weave like aging boxers don’t inspire confidence—or deserve it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Maar blijkbaar zijn het wel allemaal leiders.</p><blockquote><p>“Who am I writing for?” It’s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(It can always be taken out, but only you can put it in.)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Never say anything in writing that you wouldn’t comfortably say in conversation. If you’re not a person who says “indeed” or “moreover,” or who calls someone an individual (“he’s a fine individual”), please don’t write it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and it’s the death of freshness in anybody’s style. It’s the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People—a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you’ll sound like every hack.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter—a reminder of all the choices—and you should use it with gratitude. If, having found the scalawag and the scapegrace, you want to know how they differ, then go to the dictionary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>’s the difference between, say, “serene” and “tranquil”—one so soft, the other strangely disturbing because of the unusual n and q. Such considerations of sound and rhythm should go into everything you write.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. See if you can gain variety by reversing the order of a sentence, or by substituting a word that has freshness or oddity, or by altering the length of your sentences so they don’t all sound as if they came out of the same machine. An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch. It stays in the reader’s ear.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“We should apply the test of convenience. Does the word fill a real need? If it does, let’s give it a franchise.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We’re still left with the question: What is good usage? One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I would suggest a similar guideline for separating good English from technical English.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I don’t want to give somebody my input and get his feedback, though I’d be glad to offer my ideas and hear what he thinks of them. Good usage, to me, consists of using good words if they already exist—as they almost always do—to express myself clearly and simply to someone else. You might say it’s how I verbalize the interpersonal.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unity is the anchor of good writing. So, first, get your unities straight.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You learn to write by writing. It’s a truism, but what makes it a truism is that it’s true. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Geldt dit niet voor alles? habit is frequetie.</p><blockquote><p>Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As for what point you want to make, every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Do one thig well</p><blockquote><p>. Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but where the vibrations are good. Adjust your style accordingly and proceed to whatever destination you reach. Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan. Writing is no respecter of blueprints.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Discard plans. Bottom up.</p><blockquote><p>take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph—it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph. Try to give that sentence an extra twist of humor or surprise, like the periodic “snapper” in the routine of a stand-up comic. Make the reader smile and you’ve got him for at least one more paragraph.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Readers want to know—very soon—what’s in it for them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead. Of such a progression of sentences, each tugging the reader forward until he is hooked, a writer constructs that fateful unit, the “lead.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One moral of this story is that you should always collect more material than you will use. Every article is strong in proportion to the surplus of details from which you can choose the few that will serve you best—if you don’t go on gathering facts forever. At some point you must stop researching and start writing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another approach is to just tell a story. It’s such a simple solution, so obvious and unsophisticated, that we often forget that it’s available to us. But narrative is the oldest and most compelling method of holding someone’s attention; everybody wants to be told a story.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Always look for ways to convey your information in narrative form.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Knowing when to end an article is far more important than most writers</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Something I often do in my writing is to bring the story full circle—to strike at the end an echo of a note that was sounded at the beginning. It gratifies my sense of symmetry, and it also pleases the reader, completing with its resonance the journey we set out on together. But what usually works best is a quotation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the nonfiction writer, the simplest way of putting this into a rule is: when you’re ready to stop, stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The surprise it carries is tremendous. How could it not be a perfect ending? Surprise is the most refreshing element in nonfiction writing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work. Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch. Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Joe saw him” is strong. “He was seen by Joe” is weak. The first is short and precise; it leaves no doubt about who did what. The second is necessarily longer and it has an insipid quality:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Active verbs also enable us to visualize an activity because they require a pronoun (“he”), or a noun (“the boy”), or a person (“Mrs. Scott”) to put them in motion.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Short is better than long.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Verbs are the most important of all your tools. They push the sentence forward and give it momentum. Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you’re in a part of the country where the dirt is red, feel free to mention the red dirt. Those adjectives would do a job that the noun alone wouldn’t be doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The adjective that exists solely as decoration is a self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the reader.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don’t hedge your prose with little timidities. Good writing is lean and confident.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>LITTLE QUALIFIERS. Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw: “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense” and dozens more. They dilute your style and your persuasiveness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Very” is a useful word to achieve emphasis, but far more often it’s clutter. There’s no need to call someone very methodical. Either he is methodical or he isn’t.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Dash. Somehow this invaluable tool is widely regarded as not quite proper—a bumpkin at the genteel dinner table of good English. But it has full membership and will get you out of many tight corners.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. “We decided to keep going—it was only 100 miles more and we could</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Also resist using an exclamation point to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic. “It never occurred to me that the water pistol might be loaded!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Exclamation Point. Don’t use it unless you must to achieve a certain effect.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Humor is best achieved by understatement, and there’s nothing subtle about an exclamation point.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the semicolon brings the reader, if not to a halt, at least to a pause. So use it with discretion, remembering that it will slow to a Victorian pace the early-21st-century momentum you’re striving for, and rely instead on the period and the dash.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence. “She told me to get in the car—she had been after me all summer to have a haircut—and we drove silently into town.” An explanatory detail that might otherwise have required a separate sentence is neatly dispatched along</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Colon. The colon has begun to look even more antique than the semicolon, and many of its functions have been taken over by the dash. But it still serves well its pure role of bringing your sentence to a brief halt before you plunge into, say, an itemized list.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>more. I can’t overstate how much easier it is for readers to process a sentence if you start with “but” when you’re shifting direction. Or, conversely, how much harder it is if they must wait until the end to realize that you have shifted.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>MOOD CHANGERS. Learn to alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It announces total contrast with what has gone before, and the reader is thereby primed for the change. If you need relief from too many sentences beginning with “but,” switch to “however.” It is, however, a weaker word and needs careful placement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By its very shape the dash pushes the sentence ahead and explains why they decided to keep going.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>CONTRACTIONS. Your style will be warmer and truer to your personality if you use contractions like “I’ll” and “won’t” and “can’t” when they fit comfortably into what you’re writing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(A) “Take the shoes that are in the closet.” This means: take the shoes that are in the closet, not the ones under the bed. (B) “Take the shoes, which are in the closet.” Only one pair of shoes is under discussion;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Always use “that” unless it makes your meaning ambiguous.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>CONCEPT NOUNS. Nouns that express a concept are commonly used in bad writing instead of verbs that tell what somebody did.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If your sentence needs a comma to achieve its precise meaning, it probably needs “which.” “Which” serves a particular identifying function, different from “that.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Turn these cold sentences around. Get people doing things:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Forget the competition and go</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Often you’ll spend a whole day trying to fight your way out of some verbal thicket in which you seem to be tangled beyond salvation. Frequently a solution will occur to you the next morning when you plunge back in.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Surprisingly often a difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Keep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual—it catches the eye before it has a chance to catch the brain. Short paragraphs put air around what you write and make it look inviting, whereas a long chunk of type can discourage a reader from even starting to read.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Paragraphing is a subtle but important element in writing nonfiction articles and books—a road map constantly telling your reader how you have organized your ideas. Study good nonfiction writers to see how they do it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Elke paragraaf een atomic note??</p><blockquote><p>(I reject “he/she” altogether; the slant has no place in good English.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Rewriting is the essence of writing well: it’s where the game is won or lost. That idea is hard to accept.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I don’t like plurals; they weaken writing because they are less specific than the singular, less easy to visualize.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You won’t write well until you understand that writing is an evolving process, not a finished product.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Much of it consists of making sure you’ve given the reader a narrative flow he can follow with no trouble from beginning to end. Keep putting yourself in the reader’s place. Is there something he should have been told early in the sentence that you put near the end? Does he know when he starts sentence B that you’ve made a shift—of subject, tense, tone, emphasis—from sentence A?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Don’t annoy your readers by over-explaining—by telling them something they already know or can figure out. Try not to use words like “surprisingly,” “predictably” and “of course,” which put a value on a fact before the reader encounters the fact.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write about.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it seriously. If you follow your affections you will write well and will engage your readers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No subject is too specialized or too quirky if you make an honest connection with it when you write about it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Never go into an interview without doing whatever homework you can.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You will be resented if you inquire about facts you could have learned in advance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Tell him to stop. Just say, “Hold it a minute, please,” and write until you catch up. What you are</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Taking notes, however, has one big problem: the person you’re interviewing often starts talking faster than you can write.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Business Writing Writing in Your Job</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every human event happens somewhere, and the reader wants to know what that somewhere was like.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>People and places are the twin pillars on which most nonfiction is built.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These are subjective concepts in the eye of the beholder. One man’s romantic sunrise is another man’s hangover.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As for substance, be intensely selective. If you are describing a beach, don’t write that “the shore was scattered with rocks” or that “occasionally a seagull flew over.” Shores have a tendency to be scattered with rocks and to be flown over by seagulls.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. But as a writer I’ve learned that scientific and technical material can be made accessible to the layman. It’s just a matter of putting one sentence after another. The “after,” however, is crucial. Nowhere else must you work so hard to write sentences that form a linear sequence. This is no place for fanciful leaps or implied truths. Fact and deduction are the ruling family.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The chapter is based on a simple principle: writing is not a special language owned by the English teacher. Writing is thinking on paper. Anyone who thinks clearly can write clearly, about anything at all. Science, demystified, is just another nonfiction subject. Writing, demystified, is just another way for scientists to transmit what they know.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A tenet of journalism is that “the reader knows nothing.” As tenets go, it’s not flattering, but a technical writer can never forget it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>15 Science and Technology</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. For the principle of scientific and technical writing applies to all nonfiction writing. It’s the principle of leading readers who know nothing, step by step, to a grasp of subjects they didn’t think they had an aptitude for or were afraid they were too dumb to understand.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s no limit to how wide the pyramid can become, but your readers will understand the broad implications only if they start with one narrow fact.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can take much of the mystery out of science writing by helping the reader to identify with the scientific work being done. Again, this means looking for the human element—and if you have to settle for a chimpanzee, at least that’s the next-highest rung on the Darwinian ladder. One human element is yourself. Use your own experience to connect the reader to some mechanism that also touches his life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another personal method is to weave a scientific story around someone else.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another way to help your readers understand unfamiliar facts is to relate them to sights they are familiar with. Reduce the abstract principle to an image they can visualize.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another way of making science accessible is to write like a person and not like a scientist. It’s the same old question of being yourself. Just because you’re dealing with a scholarly discipline that’s usually reported in a style of dry pedantry is no reason why you shouldn’t write in good fresh English.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ve quoted from so many writers, writing about so many facets of the physical world, to show that they all come across first as people: men and women finding a common thread of humanity between themselves and their specialty and their readers. You can achieve the same rapport, whatever your subject. The principle of sequential writing applies to every field where the reader must be escorted over difficult new terrain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Countless careers rise or fall on the ability or the inability of employees to state a set of facts, summarize a meeting or present an idea coherently.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Administrators can be turned into human beings. Information can be imparted clearly and without pomposity. You only have to remember that readers identify with people, not with abstractions like “profitability,” or with Latinate nouns like “utilization” and “implementation,” or with inert constructions in which nobody can be visualized doing something: “pre-feasibility studies are in the paperwork stage.” Nobody</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once an administrator rises to a certain level, nobody ever points out to him again the beauty of a simple declarative sentence, or shows him how his writing has become swollen with pompous generalizations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. If what you write is ornate, or pompous, or fuzzy, that’s how you’ll be perceived. The reader has no other choice.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Managers at every level are prisoners of the notion that a simple style reflects a simple mind. Actually a simple style is the result of hard work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker or a person too arrogant, or too dumb, or too lazy to organize his thoughts.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The way to warm up any institution is to locate the missing “I.” Remember: “I” is the most interesting element in any story.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sport is now a major frontier of social change, and some of the nation’s most vexing issues—drug abuse and steroids, crowd violence, women’s rights, minorities in management, television contracts—are being played out in our stadiums, grandstands and locker rooms.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Those are the values to look for when you write about sport: people and places, time and transition.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One is that critics should like—or, better still, love—the medium they are reviewing. If you think movies are dumb, don’t write about them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yet I suggest several conditions that apply to both good reviewing and good criticism.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another rule is: don’t give away too much of the plot. Tell readers just enough to let them decide whether it’s the kind of story they tend to enjoy, but not so much that you’ll kill their enjoyment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One sentence will often do the trick.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A third principle is to use specific detail. This avoids dealing in generalities, which, being generalities, mean nothing. “The play is always fascinating” is a typical critic’s sentence. But how is it fascinating? Your idea of fascinating is different from someone else’s. Cite a few examples and let your readers weigh them on their own fascination scale.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A final caution is to avoid the ecstatic adjectives that occupy such disproportionate space in every critic’s quiver—words like “enthralling” and “luminous.” Good criticism needs a lean and vivid style to express what you observed and what you think.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In book reviewing this means allowing the author’s words to do their own documentation. Don’t say that Tom Wolfe’s style is gaudy and unusual. Quote a few of his gaudy and unusual sentences and let the reader see how quirky they are.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Humor is the secret weapon of the nonfiction writer. It’s secret because so few writers realize that humor is often their best tool—and sometimes their only tool—for making an important point.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Develop one voice that readers will recognize when they hear it on the page, a voice that’s enjoyable not only in its musical line but in its avoidance of sounds that would cheapen its tone: breeziness and condescension and clichés.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Never hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>nouns. After verbs, plain nouns are your strongest tools; they resonate with emotion.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. I’ve used writing to give myself an interesting life and a continuing education. If you write about subjects you think you would enjoy knowing about, your enjoyment will show in what you write. Learning is a tonic. That doesn’t mean you won’t be nervous when you go forth into unfamiliar terrain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Less glamorous gains made along the way—learning, wisdom, growth, confidence, dealing with failure—aren’t given the same respect because they can’t be given a grade.</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Related Notes</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://heiders.github.io/quartz/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Hidde Douna using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiddedouna>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
