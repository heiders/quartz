Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The progress of AI in the closed and orderly world of chess, with instant feedback and bottomless data, has been exponential. In the rule-bound but messier world of driving, AI has made tremendous progress, but challenges remain. In a truly open-world problem devoid of rigid rules and reams of perfect historical data, AI has been disastrous</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Might be the reason why ai and digital progress is so slow in health care.</p><blockquote><p>Chris Argyris, who helped create the Yale School of Management, noted the danger of treating the wicked world as if it is kind. He studied high-powered consultants from top business schools for fifteen years, and saw that they did really well on business school problems that were well defined and quickly assessed. But they employed what Argyris called single-loop learning, the kind that favors the first familiar solution that comes to mind. Whenever those solutions went wrong, the consultant usually got defensive. Argyris found their ‚Äúbrittle personalities‚Äù particularly surprising given that ‚Äúthe essence of their job is to teach others how to do things differently.‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Psychologist Barry Schwartz demonstrated a similar, learned inflexibility among experienced practitioners when he gave college students a logic puzzle that involved hitting switches to turn light bulbs on and off in sequence, and that they could play over and over. It could be solved in seventy different ways, with a tiny money reward for each success. The students were not given any rules, and so had to proceed by trial and error.* If a student found a solution, they repeated it over and over to get more money, even if they had no idea why it worked. Later on, new students were added, and all were now asked to discover the general rule of all solutions. Incredibly, every student who was brand-new to the puzzle discovered the rule for all seventy solutions, while only one of the students who had been getting rewarded for a single solution did. The subtitle of Schwartz‚Äôs paper: ‚ÄúHow Not to Teach People to Discover Rules‚Äù‚Äîthat is, by providing rewards for repetitive short-term success with a narrow range of solutions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When experienced accountants were asked in a study to use a new tax law for deductions that replaced a previous one, they did worse than novices. Erik Dane, a Rice University professor who studies organizational behavior, calls this phenomenon ‚Äúcognitive entrenchment.‚Äù His suggestions for avoiding it are about the polar opposite of the strict version of the ten-thousand-hours school of thought: vary challenges within a domain drastically, and, as a fellow researcher put it, insist on ‚Äúhaving one foot outside your world.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - We need more outside-in thinking to avoid this narrow view</p><a href=#chapter-2-how-the-wicked-world-was-made><h3 id=chapter-2-how-the-wicked-world-was-made><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 2: How the Wicked World Was Made</h3></a><blockquote><p>Luria found that most remote villagers were not subject to the same optical illusions as citizens of the industrialized world, like the Ebbinghaus illusion</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - This is related to the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; concept.</p><blockquote><p>Conceptual schemes are flexible, able to arrange information and ideas for a wide variety of uses, and to transfer knowledge between domains. Modern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains. Our most fundamental thought processes have changed to accommodate increasing complexity and the need to derive new patterns rather than rely only on familiar ones. Our conceptual classification schemes provide a scaffolding for connecting knowledge, making it accessible and flexible.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Modern knowledge workers need dynamic and flexible conceptual frameworks to transfer knowledge from one point to another. Such as a pkm system.</p><blockquote><p>But it is certainly true that modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of ‚Äúcategorical‚Äù thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. ‚Äú[It] is usually quite flexible,‚Äù Luria wrote. ‚ÄúSubjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‚Äòabstract thinking.‚Äô‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - This is why we need a pkm system with bidirectional linking - this helps us make new connections between subjects.</p><blockquote><p>On every exam, amid typical chemistry questions, was something like this: ‚ÄúHow many piano tuners are there in New York City?‚Äù Students had to estimate, just by reasoning, and try to get the right order of magnitude. The professor later explained that these were ‚ÄúFermi problems,‚Äù because Enrico Fermi‚Äîwho created the first nuclear reactor beneath the University of Chicago football field‚Äîconstantly made back-of-the-envelope estimates to help him approach problems.* The ultimate lesson of the question was that detailed prior knowledge was less important than a way of thinking</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - These kind of questions also come up at job interviews for condition</p><blockquote><p>a kind of thinking called ‚Äúeduction,‚Äù to work out guiding principles when given facts or materials, even in</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Make the unknown known.</p><blockquote><p>a kind of thinking called ‚Äúeduction,‚Äù to work out guiding principles when given facts or materials, even in</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Make the unknown known.</p><a href=#chapter-3-when-less-of-the-same-is-more><h3 id=chapter-3-when-less-of-the-same-is-more><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 3: When Less of the Same Is More</h3></a><blockquote><p>Even the name of the musical era, ‚ÄúBaroque,‚Äù is taken from a jewelers‚Äô term to describe a pearl that was extravagantly large and unusually shaped</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Beethoven podcast!</p><blockquote><p>It certainly goes against the deliberate practice framework, which only counts highly focused attempts at exactly the skill to be performed</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Deliberate practice is purely focusing on the exact still you want to learn. There is no collateral learning</p><blockquote><p>Parents, Yates told me, increasingly come to him and ‚Äúwant their kids doing what the Olympians are doing right now, not what the Olympians were doing when they were twelve or thirteen,‚Äù which included a wider variety of activities that developed their general athleticism and allowed them to probe their talents and interests before they focused narrowly on technical skills. The sampling period is not incidental to the development of great performers‚Äîsomething to be excised in the interest of a head start‚Äîit is integral.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - That&rsquo;s why it would be good for children to start with gymnastics and maybe one ball sport.</p><blockquote><p>less. ‚ÄúIt seems very clear,‚Äù the psychologists wrote, ‚Äúthat sheer amount of lesson or practice time is not a good indicator of exceptionality.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Number of hours is a bad metric for performance.</p><blockquote><p>The psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The strict deliberate practice school describes useful training as focused consciously on error correction. But the most comprehensive examination of development in improvisational forms, by Duke University professor Paul Berliner, described the childhoods of professionals as ‚Äúone of osmosis,‚Äù not formal instruction</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - What does osmosis mean in this context?</p><blockquote><p>Improv masters learn like babies: dive in and imitate and improvise first, learn the formal rules later.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - This is how my kids learn, they watch, imitate and just start doing things to see what happens.</p><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs easier for a jazz musician to learn to play classical literature than for a classical player to learn how to play jazz,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe jazz musician is a creative artist, the classical musician is a re-creative artist.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - It&rsquo;s easier to go from generalist to specialist than vice verse</p><blockquote><p>In totality, the picture is in line with a classic research finding that is not specific to music: breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer. That is, the more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example. Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they‚Äôve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - The more context (connections) you give to a note in pkm system the more established this info gets and the better remember it</p><blockquote><p>creativity may be difficult to nurture, but it is easy to thwart</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The parents with creative children made their opinions known after their kids did something they didn‚Äôt like, they just did not proscribe it beforehand. Their households were low on prior restraint.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs strange,‚Äù Cecchini told me at the end of one of our hours-long discussions, ‚Äúthat some of the greatest musicians were self-taught or never learned to read music. I‚Äôm not saying one way is the best, but now I get a lot of students from schools that are teaching jazz, and they all sound the same. They don‚Äôt seem to find their own voice. I think when you‚Äôre self-taught you experiment more, trying to find the same sound in different places, you learn how to solve problems.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Self-taught means that you have very specific knowledge that only you have, because nobody else has followed your exact learning trajectory.</p><a href=#chapter-4-learning-fast-and-slow><h3 id=chapter-4-learning-fast-and-slow><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 4: Learning, Fast and Slow</h3></a><blockquote><p>There were similarities too. In every classroom in every country, teachers relied on two main types of questions.
The more common were ‚Äúusing procedures‚Äù questions: basically, practice at something that was just learned. For instance, take the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon (180 √ó (number of polygon sides ‚àí 2)), and apply it to polygons on a worksheet. The other common variety was ‚Äúmaking connections‚Äù questions, which connected students to a broader concept, rather than just a procedure. That was more like when the teacher asked students why the formula works, or made them try to figure out if it works for absolutely any polygon from a triangle to an octagon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despite the teacher‚Äôs clever vignettes, it is clear that students do not understand how these numbers and letters might be useful anywhere but on a school worksheet. When she asks where variable expressions might be used in the world, Patrick answers: when you‚Äôre trying to figure out math problems.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Problems need to be related to the real world and actual day to day situations for people to understand and see the value.</p><blockquote><p>Rather than letting students grapple with some confusion, teachers often responded to their solicitations with hint-giving that morphed a making-connections problem into a using-procedures one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Making-connections problems did not survive the teacher-student interactions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>content.‚Äù (There is a specific Japanese word to describe chalkboard writing that tracks conceptual connections over the course of collective problem solving: bansho.)</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - This is really interesting!</p><blockquote><p>Teachers in every country fell into the same trap at times, but in the higher-performing countries plenty of making-connections problems remained that way as the class struggled to figure them out.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>for knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, ‚Äúinterleaving.‚Äù
Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When younger students bring home problems that force them to make connections, Richland told me, ‚Äúparents are like, ‚ÄòLemme show you, there‚Äôs a faster, easier way.‚Äô‚Äù If the teacher didn‚Äôt already turn the work into using-procedures practice, well-meaning parents will. They aren‚Äôt comfortable with bewildered kids, and they want understanding to come quickly and easily. But for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Let your children solve problems on their own</p><blockquote><p>Kornell was explaining the concept of ‚Äúdesirable difficulties,‚Äù obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - This feels like the fact that we should not always go for immediate shortterm rewards as described in atomic habits.</p><blockquote><p>One of those desirable difficulties is known as the ‚Äúgeneration effect.‚Äù Struggling to generate an answer on your own, even a wrong one, enhances subsequent learning. Socrates was apparently on to something when he forced pupils to generate answers rather than bestowing them. It requires the learner to intentionally sacrifice current performance for future benefit.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Similar for taking notes and rewriting info in your own words?</p><blockquote><p>Being forced to generate answers improves subsequent learning even if the generated answer is wrong. It can even help to be wildly wrong. Metcalfe and colleagues have repeatedly demonstrated a ‚Äúhypercorrection effect.‚Äù The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer. Tolerating big mistakes can create the best learning opportunities.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Could this effect be used in marketing? Ask customers a generating question and provide the answer later?
The bigger you fail, the more you learn.</p><blockquote><p>The study conclusion was simple: ‚Äútraining with hints did not produce any lasting learning.‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Used for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - My way of learning for rest was by making a Los of old tests. Essentially, this is exactly whet is described here as learning without hints, self-testing.</p><blockquote><p>If that eighth-grade classroom followed a typical academic plan over the course of the year, it is precisely the opposite of what science recommends for durable learning‚Äîone topic was probably confined to one week and another to the next. Like a lot of professional development efforts, each particular concept or skill gets a short period of intense focus, and then on to the next thing, never to return. That structure makes intuitive sense, but it forgoes another important desirable difficulty: ‚Äúspacing,‚Äù or distributed practice.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Spaced-repetition.</p><blockquote><p>spacing made learning more productive by making it easy to make it hard.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Desirable difficulty</p><blockquote><p>Repetition, it turned out, was less important than struggle.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - In contrast to habit creation, there it needs to be easy and repetition is key.</p><blockquote><p>Knowledge increasingly needs not merely to be durable, but also flexible‚Äîboth sticky and capable of broad application.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Big implication for modern knowledge workers. Again, this necessitates the use of a pkm system, this is both sticky due to elaboration and the bidirectional linking makes for a broad application.</p><blockquote><p>The feeling of learning, it turns out, is based on before-your-eyes progress, while deep learning is not. ‚ÄúWhen your intuition says block,‚Äù Kornell told me, ‚Äúyou should probably interleave.‚Äù</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Interleaving is a desirable difficulty that frequently holds for both physical and mental skills.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whether the task is mental or physical, interleaving improves the ability to match the right strategy to a problem. That happens to be a hallmark of expert problem solving.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Figuring out the exact problem instead of learning procedures for exact same problems. Reminds me of RSM training identifying the right question.</p><blockquote><p>Kind learning environment experts choose a strategy and then evaluate; experts in less repetitive environments evaluate and then choose.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Desirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The research team recommended that if programs want to impart lasting academic benefits they should focus instead on ‚Äúopen‚Äù skills that scaffold later knowledge. Teaching kids to read a little early is not a lasting advantage. Teaching them how to hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read can be. As with all desirable difficulties, the trouble is that a head start comes fast, but deep learning is slow. ‚ÄúThe slowest growth,‚Äù the researchers wrote, occurs ‚Äúfor the most complex skills.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Exactly what taking smart notes argues.</p><blockquote><p>Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems.</p></blockquote><a href=#chapter-5-thinking-outside-experience><h3 id=chapter-5-thinking-outside-experience><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 5: Thinking Outside Experience</h3></a><blockquote><p>Deep analogical thinking is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface.

Students might learn about the motion of molecules by analogy to billiard-ball collisions; principles of electricity can be understood with analogies to water flow through plumbing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Related to MAYA.</p><blockquote><p>Most problems, of course, are not new, so we can rely on what Gentner calls ‚Äúsurface‚Äù analogies from our own experience. ‚ÄúMost of the time, if you‚Äôre reminded of things that are similar on the surface, they‚Äôre going to be relationally similar as well,‚Äù she explained.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A gift of a single analogy from a different domain tripled the proportion of solvers who got the radiation problem.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Very powerful!</p><blockquote><p>Most problem solvers are not like Kepler. They will stay inside of the problem at hand, focused on the internal details, and perhaps summon other medical knowledge, since it is on the surface a medical problem. They will not intuitively turn to distant analogies to probe solutions. They should, though, and they should make sure some of those analogies are, on the surface, far removed from the current problem. In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - We need more outside-in thinking! Across, disciplines that at first are unrelated.</p><blockquote><p>Our natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the ‚Äúoutside view.‚Äù The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bent Flyvbjerg, chair of Major Programme Management at Oxford University‚Äôs business school, has shown that around 90 percent of major infrastructure projects worldwide go over budget (by an average of 28 percent) in part because managers focus on the details of their project and become overly optimistic. Project managers can become like Kahneman‚Äôs curriculum-building team, which decided that thanks to its roster of experts it would certainly not encounter the same delays as did other groups. Flyvbjerg studied a project to build a tram system in Scotland, in which an outside consulting team actually went through an analogy process akin to what the private equity investors were instructed to do. They ignored specifics of the project at hand and focused on others with structural similarities. The consulting team saw that the project group had made a rigorous analysis using all of the details of the work to be done. And yet, using analogies to separate projects, the consulting team concluded that the cost projection of ¬£320 million (more than $400 million) was probably a massive underestimate. When the tram opened three years late, it was headed toward ¬£1 billion. After that, other UK infrastructure projects began implementing outside[‚Ä¶]</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Our access trajectories are similar.

If you‚Äôre asked to predict whether a particular horse will win a race or a particular politician will win an election, the more internal details you learn about any particular scenario‚Äîphysical qualities of the specific horse, the background and strategy of the particular politician‚Äîthe more likely you are to say that the scenario you are investigating will occur. &mldr; the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before &mldr; the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before &mldr; the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before &mldr; the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before &mldr; the absence of instructions, and even when they had never seen the material before &mldr; When a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called ‚Äúfar transfer.‚Äù &mldr; But the idea that surface analogies that pop to mind work for novel problems is a ‚Äúkind world‚Äù hypothesis, Gentner told me. Like kind learning environments, a kind world is based on repeating patterns. &mldr; In one famous study, participants judged an individual as more likely to die from ‚Äúheart disease, cancer, or other natural causes‚Äù than from ‚Äúnatural causes.‚Äù Focusing narrowly on many fine details specific to a problem at hand feels like the exact right thing to do, when it is often exactly wrong.</p></blockquote><a href=#introduction-roger-vs-tiger><h3 id=introduction-roger-vs-tiger><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>INTRODUCTION: Roger vs. Tiger</h3></a><blockquote><p>Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts.
