And when they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied: ‘Why, how did I know you’d notice?

That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>PRINCIPLE 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: ‘How can I make this person want to do it?’</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[Who cares about your company desires?</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - In onze mails staat aaltijd: NVS wilt X</p><blockquote><p>They don’t realise that neither you nor I want to buy anything.

He who cannot walks a lonely way.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>PRINCIPLE 3 Arouse in the other person an eager want.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So we wrote them, saying we admired their work and were deeply interested in getting their advice and learning the secrets of their success. Each of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty students. We said we realised that these authors were busy – too busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for them to answer about themselves and their methods of work. They liked that. Who wouldn’t like it?</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Interresante manier om sprekers over te halen</p><blockquote><p>Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it – and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The executive who tells me he can’t remember names is at the same time telling me he can’t remember a significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand.’</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Gebruik anki for hcp flashcards met foto, naam en intereses.</p><blockquote><p>One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: ‘To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship.

A person’s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a conversation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>IN A NUTSHELL SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU PRINCIPLE 1 Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2 Smile. PRINCIPLE 3 Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4 Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5 Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. PRINCIPLE 6 Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s good will?

He can’t keep on all afternoon saying, “It’s the best” when I’m agreeing with him. We then get off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good points of the White truck.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Heeft te maken met conflict is differentiatie</p><blockquote><p>As wise old Ben Franklin used to say: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ‘When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: ‘We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.’ Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions: Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot. Over three hundred years ago Galileo said: You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself. As Lord Chesterfield said to his son: Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so. Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens: One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Few people are logical.

Some suggestions to accomplish this: PRINCIPLE 1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation. PRINCIPLE 2 Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. PRINCIPLE 3 Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person. PRINCIPLE 4 Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. PRINCIPLE 5 Let the other person save face. PRINCIPLE 6 Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.
