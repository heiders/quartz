Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Habits is een heuristiek?</p><blockquote><p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Habit is getraijd in systeem 1 en systeem 2 is bottleneck</p><blockquote><p>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Interessant voor launch!</p><blockquote><p>the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Minimalism.

The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every habit is context dependent.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>and visualizes a need for it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>7 The Secret to Self-Control</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Brood in vriezer</p><blockquote><p>You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Scientists refer to this as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Behalve als de reward dus op rando tijdstip wordt gegeven.</p><blockquote><p>These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing you want to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful. Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>He says things like: You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you. You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all. You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some of our underlying motives include:* Conserve energy Obtain food and water Find love and reproduce Connect and bond with others Win social acceptance and approval Reduce uncertainty Achieve status and prestige</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the appropriate response.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Stoic. Ik lijd en wordt geleefd door mijn passies.</p><blockquote><p>To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently sensing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation. If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Sterk!</p><blockquote><p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Email is otion</p><blockquote><p>In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Mooe uitspraak. Barrriere doorbreken</p><blockquote><p>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Net alpower auto.mate.s</p><blockquote><p>Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>THE HABIT LINE FIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>habits form based on frequency, not time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Denk aan project eliminate</p><blockquote><p>eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible.

Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Pareto rule</p><blockquote><p>What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the present more than the future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary. What can we do to make tracking easier? First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Iets met een smart contract?</p><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Competence is highly dependent on context.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Als je een hoger denkvieau hebt betekent dat niet dat je de inerliggende niveaus beheerst</p><blockquote><p>A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule. The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>THE GOLDILOCKS RULE FIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just manageable difficulty.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sorites Paradox,* which talks about the effect one small action can have when repeated enough times. One formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>With a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - See discipline of desire</p><blockquote><p>Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope.
