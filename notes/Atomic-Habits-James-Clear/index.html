Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p></blockquote><a href=#3--how-to-build-better-habits-in-4-simple-steps><h4 id=3--how-to-build-better-habits-in-4-simple-steps><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps</h4></a><blockquote><p>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Habits is een heuristiek?</p><blockquote><p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Habit is getraijd in systeem 1 en systeem 2 is bottleneck</p><blockquote><p>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p></blockquote><a href=#the-1st-law--make-it-obvious><h3 id=the-1st-law--make-it-obvious><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>THE 1ST LAW Make It Obvious</h3></a><a href=#4--the-man-who-didnt-look-right><h4 id=4--the-man-who-didnt-look-right><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4 The Man Who Didn’t Look Right</h4></a><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.

For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.</p></blockquote><a href=#7--the-secret-to-self-control><h4 id=7--the-secret-to-self-control><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7 The Secret to Self-Control</h4></a><blockquote><p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - Brood in vriezer</p><blockquote><p>You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life.

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.

Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.

But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary. What can we do to make tracking easier? First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain.

It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.

At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her</p></blockquote><a href=#conclusion--the-secret-to-results-that-last><h4 id=conclusion--the-secret-to-results-that-last><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion The Secret to Results That Last</h4></a><blockquote><p>With a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[note]</strong> - See discipline of desire</p><blockquote><p>Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.”</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Notes leading here</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Marginal-gains-are-magnified-by-accumulation/ data-ctx="James Clear" data-src=/notes/Marginal-gains-are-magnified-by-accumulation class=internal-link>Marginal gains are magnified by accumulation</a></li><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Marginal-gains-are-magnified-by-time/ data-ctx="James Clear" data-src=/notes/Marginal-gains-are-magnified-by-time class=internal-link>Marginal gains are magnified by time</a></li><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Some-habits-are-compounding-some-are-just-marginal-gains/ data-ctx="James Clear" data-src=/notes/Some-habits-are-compounding-some-are-just-marginal-gains class=internal-link>Some habits are compounding, some are just marginal gains</a></li><li><a href=/quartz/notes/Success-is-dependent-on-sustainable-improvements/ data-ctx="James Clear" data-src=/notes/Success-is-dependent-on-sustainable-improvements class=internal-link>Success is dependent on sustainable improvements</a></li><li><a href=/quartz/notes/You-are-your-habits/ data-ctx="James Clear" data-src=/notes/You-are-your-habits class=internal-link>You are your habits</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://heiders.github.io/quartz/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Hidde Douna using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://heiders.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiddedouna>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
